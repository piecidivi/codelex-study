Recipes App

The app is designed to accept ingredients for recipes in units of pieces, grams, milliliters, teaspoons, tablespoons,
glasses, and pinches as it usually happens with recipes. Basket is filled with items in units of pieces, grams, and
milliliters. App will convert and calculate values to find out if items in the basket are enough to make a salad.
Unfortunately, UI is not ready. Main file will run pre-defined events and list outcome.
