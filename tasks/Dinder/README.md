Dinder is a Tinder-like app to set profile name and picture and check out other pictures depending on preference.<br/>
It involves thorough back-end validation for all the input. Unique IDs are generated based on the current time in microseconds
to manage media storage, with symlink for access.<br/>
The app is written in PHP using MVC architecture and Service-Repository pattern. The front-end is built with Twig and JavaScript.
